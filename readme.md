# Lestora Debugger

This is a standalone client mod that allows other mods to take control of a new custom F3 screen.  By default, this will show coords, facing direction, and block light level.  Let me know if you think it should show more by default.

Other mods (Lestora or otherwise) can use this mod to "subscribe" some of their inner mod detail so that it can be conditionally seen in realtime.  I use this in other mods for things like showing the player's wetness and temperature while developing.

## Features
- **Usage:** Press F3 to turn the debug screen on and off.  This operates different depending upon whether the Minecraft F3 screen is enabled or not.
- **Priority:** The higher the number, the more the priority.  1 would therefore be the lowest/last priority, and 0 means it would be disabled.

## Manual Installation
1. Download the mod JAR from CurseForge.
2. Place the JAR file into your `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.

## Commands
- Use the command `/lestora debug listIgnoredKeys` will show you which datum points have been filtered out.
- Use the command `/lestora debug ignoreKey [key name]` will ignore that one datum point.  Grouped options starting with ! will ignore all datum points related to that group.
- Use the command `/lestora debug allowKey [key name]` will un-ignore that one datum point.  Grouped options starting with ! will un-ignore all datum points related to that group.

## Compatibility
- **Minecraft Version:** 1.21.4
- **Forge Version:** 54.1.0

## Troubleshooting
If you run into issues (e.g., crashes or unexpected behavior), check the logs in your `crash-reports` or `logs` folder. You can also open an issue on the modâ€™s GitHub repository.
